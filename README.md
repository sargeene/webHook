Azure Container Registry (ACR) is integrated with Kubernetes for container management. The built Docker container is pushed into the Azure Container Registry (ACR) and the image is deployed into the Azure Kubernetes Registry (AKS) cluster. 

Azure DevOps is used for CI/CD pipeline automation, streamlining the software development lifecycle through automated build, test, and release pipelines.
